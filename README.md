#### 3.2 Draft
The importance of CPD and its contribution to improved professionalism and own learning. *Article Heading

The importance of CPD is often seen as integral, but what exactly is CPD and why does it matter? CPD an acrynom of Continuing Proffessional development,refers to the process of tracking and documenting the skills, knowledge and experience gained both formally and informally as you work, beyond any initial training. It's essentially a record of what you may experience, learn and then apply, further used as a reference to any physical folder or portfolio documenting your development as a professional.  

why does it matter? CPD as a proccess is broader than you may think, helping many to manage their self-development on an ongoing basis. Its function or purpose to help you record, review and reflect on what you learn, more than simply filling in tick boxes.

Are their any negatives to this methoglody? Flaws in the conceptual ideology of methodologies are conclusive, meaning that it is not plausible for the methodologies concieved by humans to be perfect or flawless. Though this does not mean that it is overly bad, rather the proccess of continuing self development includes numerous benefits for instance;  

- provides an overview of your professional development to date

- reminds you of your achievements and how far you've progressed

- directs your career and helps you keep your eye on your goals

- uncovers gaps in your skills and capabilities

- Opens up further development needs

- provides examples and scenarios for a CV or interview

- demonstrates your professional standing to clients and employers

- helps you with your career development or a possible career change. 

The negatives are rather tame in this retrospec only leading to repetition, intense boredom or a tedious process and structure to follow.

The continuation of professional development is crucial in the modern day market, if I were to relate it to my own experience I have in-directly and still am using continued proffessional development, with the formulation of a new course (Video Game Design and Production/ Computer Science masked with the veil of apps and video games) hosted at the West Herts College, different to other HND's, it is focused specifically around the development of developing the students into proffessionals,treating them as employees rather than students, encouraging them to work on their portfolio giving neigh to free rien in comparision to other courses, focusing less on due dates,assigments or curriclum and more on projects and tasks. 

My most recent development sought me working with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL for short) for the duration of 4-5 weeks creating an app based on the amount of Green House Gases released during the manufacturing and production proccess of four products,their affects on four different habitats or terrain (Artic/Tundra,Rainforest,British Countryside,Ocean.) with the app further based around a green house gas chain and the arrangement of said chain, essentially the app was built around the ideology of refering to the user's memory and ability to proccess (memory game) with the mask of the Client's green house gases (chain/theme).  Though it was decided that my groups app would not be offically chosen or used the worked applied may still be used as reference and applied to my portfolio showing that I have worked proffesionally with clients and may also be used to compare with projects I do with other real-life clients later down the line to show my personal development.
